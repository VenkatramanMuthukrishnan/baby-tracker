# Features

Create a new baby by entering his/her name in the designated field. Afterwards
you will receive a unique id which represents your baby. Share this id with
your husband, family and friends. All inserts, updates and deletes will be
synced to everyone in realtime, thanks to the magic of websockets.

At the moment four activities can be tracked.
